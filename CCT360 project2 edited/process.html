		<h2 class="mt-3">Plan:</h2>
		<p class="text">I usually start from drawing the wireframe to organize my contents. However, this time I plan to do it opposite way, because everytime I found wireframe sometime is hard to implement for some reason. I need to change it over and over again whenever I found difficult to implement it. I had experiences for create a personal website (CCT260). At that time I wasn't familiar with HTML/CSS so I did it pretty roughly. I always want to create a personal website by using more of my existing skills. Thus, I choose to do personal website for this assignment. I paln to have my personal website in five pages: Intro, About me, My production, My CV, Gallery with two pages process and Contact form. Totally seven pages website.</p>
		
		
		<h2>Prorcess:</h2>
		
		<p class="text">Firstly, I looked up the bootstrap official website and W3school to understand what function can bootstrap provides and save some useful functions for later use. Then I drawed the structure of my pages to see which function fits in the content of my page. Then I looked up some personal wewbsite example to have some ideas of choosing the contents. I want to have a home page to display my life style and a page to place my project I made from other courses to illustrate my skills (My productions). I also need a page to summerize myself (About me). A page to place my images (Gallery). Also a page for my CV maybe I something HR will want to look at when browsing my website. Then I want to make my home page to display my life style as priority without to much conntents. I looked at other people's personal website, thanksfully I think most people's personal website contain those contents like I thought. Then I start to build the website and I found that it is much easiler to use bootstrap to get the website  structure done than just HTML/CSS. So I have much more flexibility to customized my thought by using boostrap framework. But I also found there are some disavantage of bootstrap which is some default bootstrap CSS using !important, which takes me sometimes to debug it.  I want to fulfill my assignment requirements of bootstrap frameworks. Thus, I basically done everything with bootstrap, except for color modification. Since I wasn't familiar with bootstrap before, so I often googled the function I want if I cannot found in W3school. After done the basic structure of every pages, I choose the color and check whether the pages are responsive of different size of screen.</p>
		
		<h2>Rationale:</h2>
		<p class="text">When I choosing the color of my website, I looked up other people's personal website, and I was choosen the bule and grey color as my thmem color. However, I asked some of my friends in VCC major (they know more about color selection). They think the colors I choose wasn't suitable for my website. Since there are three four pages has embed videos or carsoul or images. So I cannot choose too colorful background color. Thus, I tried several colors sets to see which is best fit for my content. After tried different choice, I decided use simple black, white, grey color to form my website, which can provides more elegant and professional feeling for audiences. Then I also think it is good for Google SEO to have keywords and external links in a website, so I linked my Instagram accounts and LinkedIn account at the footer, people can just click on its and its will lead them to my Instagram account and LinkeIn account. I think at the footer it is also important to have a little intereaction with audiences, thus I place a toolpit to let audiences feel it is fun while browsing my website. I don't want my home page to be content heavy, so I just placed a simple carousle to display my life style. When I design the page of MY CV I want it to looks organized and well displayed. So I use the progrss bar to illustrate to progress on different jobs and Education status. Also I want to gives people some details of my job description, but in order to do that, the page will looks to crowded and content heavy. So I choose to use collapse function to organized it, which can make people who do not want to see details of my position description feel clearer while browsing this page and who want to see details can click on it to see the description. For the gallery I want to display my images in various way, so some pictures I used column picture and some picture is vertically. </p>
		
		<h2>Difficulties:</h2>
		<p class="text">I found some difficult parts while doing this assignment mostly from the responsive part. Sometimes things can be sorted by col-12 boostrap framework, which is good to use. However, When I do "about me" page I found that it is really difficult to call the col function and my image would stretch when I adjust my screen size. Also, for the gallery and carusel parts I found I need to adjust my images aspect ratios by photoshop before insert them into HTML. Mostly of the hard part I found are related with adjust image size and make the website responsive.</p>
		
		<h2>Usability and Accessibility:</h2>
		<p class="text">I used Wave extension to check on my website accessibility and I notice that I did not put the alt tags for some images. So I modify it, also I check on whether my website is responsive by adjust my screen size. I found it is so hard to adjust some contents to be readable on different screen size, which took me lots of time to spend on it. I also check on my contract ratio for my background and my content.</p>
